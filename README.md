**Where is Paul?** is a spatial web app — a living record of a life on a 3D globe. Cities, crossings, and stays glow on a luminous Earth. Time is navigable. Moments appear as posts, cards, videos, and comic-book sequences drawn from real photographs.

Same URL on a phone, a desk, and Safari on Vision Pro. Pinch to zoom. Look to look around. No extra session. No app store binary.

Hex **color** on the globe encodes how long you stayed — not height.

**Make your own:** clone the repo, run it locally, replace the data. Pins live in one file. People, stories, and media sit next to it. [How to set yours up](#make-your-own).

## What you’ll find

- **Interactive 3D globe** — location markers on a glowing Earth. Stay duration is the hex color.
- **Timeline** — move through years and open the stories tied to a place.
- **Mixed story formats** — posts, swipeable cards, short videos, comic sequences.
- **Real life → comic** — photographs turned into illustrated pages without losing what happened.
- **The people** — short videos in their own voices.

## Why this exists

A trail of travel and self-challenge. Proof that a full life is possible — not advice, not a product launch.

## Make your own

This is a static site. No database. No backend. No account. No algorithm ranking who sees what. You decide what exists by what you put in the files.

### Run it locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulvisciano/where-is-paul.git
cd where-is-paul
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Don’t open `index.html` as a file — posts fetch over HTTP.

Earth textures load from unpkg. Images already in this repo point at my Cloudflare R2 bucket, so you’ll still need the network until you swap them.

### Where the data lives

The app is a shell. Almost everything you see is data files loaded by `index.html`:

| What | Where | How it loads |
|---|---|---|
| Globe pins, timeline, comics, post metadata | `moments/moments.js` → `window.momentsInTime` | Script tag |
| People | `characters/characters.js` → `window.characters` | Script tag |
| Written posts | `moments/<city>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/content.html` | Fetched when you open the pin |
| Comic pages | URLs on the moment (`pages`) or files in that folder | Comic reader |
| Photos / video | Local path, `attachment://…`, or any `https://` URL | Moments + characters |
| Branding | `index.html`, `manifest.json` | Browser |

`.env` is **not** read at runtime.

There is no tracker, no auth, no ads. `localStorage` is used only to hide the first-run hint.

### Minimum: replace the pins

Edit `moments/moments.js`. Replace the `window.momentsInTime` array with your stays. One object per pin:

```js
{
  id: "lisbon-2025-10-12",
  title: "Lisbon",
  date: new Date("2025-10-12T00:00:00Z"),
  timelineHighlight: "Lisbon",
  tags: ["city"],
  snippet: "One paragraph. This is the card on the globe.",
  fullLink: "#",
  image: "/moments/lisbon/2025-10-12/image-thumb.webp",
  imageAlt: "Lisbon",
  location: { lat: 38.7223, lng: -9.1393, name: "Lisbon, Portugal" },
  stayDuration: 12,
  formattedDuration: formatDuration(12)
}
```

`stayDuration` is days. That number is the hex color: a few days stay bright orange, months go darker. Not height.

To drop my people, set `window.characters = []` in `characters/characters.js`.

That’s enough for a globe of your life. Everything below is optional.

### Add a written post

1. Create `moments/<city>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/content.html`
2. Point the moment at it:

```js
fullLink: "/moments/lisbon/2025-10-12",
contentFile: "/moments/lisbon/2025-10-12/content.html",
```

### Add a comic

```js
isComic: true,
comicReaderVersion: 4,
cover: "/moments/lisbon/2025-10-12/cover.webp",
pages: [
  "/moments/lisbon/2025-10-12/page-01.webp",
  "/moments/lisbon/2025-10-12/page-02.mp4"
],
pageCount: 2
```

Pages can be images or video. HTTPS URLs (your own bucket) work the same as local paths.

### Add people

Edit `characters/characters.js`. Each person:

```js
{
  id: "ada",
  name: "Ada",
  role: "Friend",
  description: "One line.",
  bio: "A short bio, in their words or yours.",
  avatar: "/characters/ada-avatar.webp",
  pageImage: "/characters/ada.webp",
  pageVideo: "/characters/ada.mp4",
  imageAlt: "Ada",
  tags: ["friend"],
  relationship: "How they sit in the story"
}
```

`pageVideo` is the clip in their own voice. Skip it if you don’t have one.

### Media

Keep files in the repo, or host them at any `https://` URL (your own Cloudflare R2 bucket, etc.).

Do not keep using `pub-9466bb5132e74aeba333004ad0c21f21.r2.dev` — that’s my bucket.

### Publish

It’s static. Vercel, GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static host. `vercel.json` is already in the repo.

You decide what’s public by what you commit. Drafts and raw exports belong in `raw/` — that folder is gitignored.

If your years aren’t 1988–2026, update `YEAR_TICK_POS` in `components/footer.js` so the timeline minimap matches.

Rebrand `index.html` (title, meta, OG tags) and `manifest.json` (name). If you deploy under a subpath, add it to `KNOWN_PREFIXES` in `index.html` and `lib/basePath.js`. Localhost and a domain root need nothing.
